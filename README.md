# Root Route

# Welcome to Root Route!

## Created by Ryan Moore, Melika Kalbasi, Christie Byrne, Lindsey Walker

### Overview
We created Root Route, an app where users can follow our suggested pathway to learn the skills necessary to be a full-stack developer. Before we started coding bootcamp, we were interested in learning to code, but found the overwhelming amount of online courses difficult to navigate. We also were not privy to which languages would be best to learn for beginners, or the suggested order of learning them. We created this platform to help give users a clear pathway to finding the best tools to be a web developer.

Root Route allows you to track your progress by showing if you are actively working on a course, or if you have completed it, so that you never lose your place. 
-We also may add in indication if a course is free..

### Log In Authentication

When user wants to log in we send an authentication request to Passport to check if the email and password entered match any of our database. If yes, user is granted access to profile.
